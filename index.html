					<h2> I believe in the importance of Education 🎓</h2>
						<p>
						I am passionate about Education and Pedagogy. During the childhood development stages, the importance of education is stronger than ever. It’s a time for children to learn social and mental skills that will be crucial for their growth and success in the future. Education at childhood also offers a chance for self-discovery and to learn about their unique interests. The importance of education in our lives goes far beyond what we can read in a textbook. Education also provides childhood with knowledge such as how to produce artwork and make music. Education allows us to analyze what’s in front of us, and even learn from our mistakes. By learning from a young age, children are given the chance to start building goals for themselves. Education means having the logic to set your mind to something and achieve it.

					<h2>I believe in the power of Pedagogy 🏆</h2>
						<p>
						The ancient Greek word, παιδαγωγός or paidagōgos, etymologically had a very specific connotation. The “paidagog” of Plato’s time was an adult who — in servitude — and with great care, literally walked children to school each day. In ancient times, the word was taken to mean, the one who guides, protects or leads. The pedagogy focuses on students’ needs, backgrounds, interests and holds individual human freedoms as preeminent. It also makes the development of individual human potential central to the learning process, focusing on experiential, social and holistic education.

					<h2>Educational Technologies 🚀</h2>
						<p>
						I am passionate about the Edtech sector. Education Technology (also known as “EdTech”) refers to an area of technology devoted to the development and application of tools (including software, hardware, and processes) intended to promote education. Put another way, “EdTech is a study and ethical practice for facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources.” Although this developing field may sound like a specialized niche, its potential implications are far-reaching and affect many segments of the population.
